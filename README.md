I’m @khremeviuc1004

I am a senior software engineer with 20+ years experience as a Java enterprise developer using both enterprise stacks: Java EE and Spring.

I create electronic music for a hobby using digital audio work stations, software synthesizers and software effects. I do this on Linux because I love the freedom it gives me (I hate being pestered by intrusive applications).

The repositories in this account will all, pretty much, be related to electronic music making. 

I started writing a DAW (Digital Audio workstation) in C++ but found the lack of clear information, no package  manager, bad error messages, more gotchas than you can poke a stick at and the seg faulting to be too much - I make mistakes and C++ is too unforgiving and unhelpful. Lately I have tried the rust programming language and although the learning curve is just as steep as C++, rust is actually very informative - I have had to think very hard about how to structure my application in terms of cross thread access and have many arguments with the borrow checker but it is still way better than C++ (I do miss object oriented flexibility though).
